*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
head(df_titanic)
```

**Observations**:

Each configuration has the following attributes:

-   Class
-   Sex
-   Age
-   Survived
-   n (number in said configuration)

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

**Observations**:

-   Write your observations here
-   Are there any differences?
    -   Wikipedia says that 2,208 people were on the ship, which is a difference of 7 people.
-   If yes, what might account for those differences?
    -   The data set might be incomplete.
    -   The data set might measure what constitutes a "soul on board" differently than Wikipedia.
    -   The numbers might have been measured at different points along the journey.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Number of Survivors")
```

**Observations**:

-   This plot makes it seem like Male passengers survived more, but this is not the full truth. The survival rate (percentage of people who survived out of people who did not) is higher for Female passengers. We are just not looking at the passengers who did not survive.
-   It is interesting that the difference of Sexes of the crew members who survived is so different.
-   Additionally, the number of second class male passengers that survived is disproportionately small.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

```{r q4-task}
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Proportion of Survivors")
```

**Observations**:

-   The first class and second class had higher survival rates than the other groups.
-   Female passengers tended to have higher survival rates than other groups.
-   Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
    -   It does not take into account the different age groups. Among other things, this makes it look like all of the first class passengers survived which is not true.
    -   There is also a problem with rows that are missing values. I think this happens because there are no children in the crew.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```{r q5-task}
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Proportion of Survivors") +
  facet_grid(~ Age)
```

**Observations**:

-   Children have a relatively high survival rate compared to adults.
-   Female passengers tend to have higher survival rates than their Male counterparts.
-   There are no children who are crew members.
-   First class adults have higher survival rates than other class adult passengers.
-   If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain the fishy-ness.
    -   The plot before was not correctly displaying the difference between adult and child passengers. The new plot separates them which makes it much easier to read.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
