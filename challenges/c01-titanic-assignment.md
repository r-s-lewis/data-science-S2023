*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category    | Needs Improvement                                                                                                | Satisfactory                                                                                                               |

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
head(df_titanic)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 5
    ##   Class Sex    Age   Survived     n
    ##   <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
    ## 1 1st   Male   Child No           0
    ## 2 2nd   Male   Child No           0
    ## 3 3rd   Male   Child No          35
    ## 4 Crew  Male   Child No           0
    ## 5 1st   Female Child No           0
    ## 6 2nd   Female Child No           0

**Observations**:

Each configuration has the following attributes:

- Class
- Sex
- Age
- Survived
- n (number in said configuration)

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - Wikipedia says that 2,208 people were on the ship, which is a
    difference of 7 people.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - The data set might be incomplete.
  - The data set might measure what constitutes a “soul on board”
    differently than Wikipedia.
  - The numbers might have been measured at different points along the
    journey.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Number of Survivors")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- This plot makes it seem like Male passengers survived more, but this
  is not the full truth. The survival rate (percentage of people who
  survived out of people who did not) is higher for Female passengers.
  We are just not looking at the passengers who did not survive.
- It is interesting that the difference of Sexes of the crew members who
  survived is so different.
- Additionally, the number of second class male passengers that survived
  is disproportionately small.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Proportion of Survivors")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The first class and second class had higher survival rates than the
  other groups.
- Female passengers tended to have higher survival rates than other
  groups.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - It does not take into account the different age groups. Among other
    things, this makes it look like all of the first class passengers
    survived which is not true.
  - There is also a problem with rows that are missing values. I think
    this happens because there are no children in the crew.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Proportion of Survivors") +
  facet_grid(~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Children have a relatively high survival rate compared to adults.
- Female passengers tend to have higher survival rates than their Male
  counterparts.
- There are no children who are crew members.
- First class adults have higher survival rates than other class adult
  passengers.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - The plot before was not correctly displaying the difference between
    adult and child passengers. The new plot separates them which makes
    it much easier to read.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
